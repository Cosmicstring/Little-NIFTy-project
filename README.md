# Little-NIFTy-project

A little project done during the NIFTy course given by the [IFT group](https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~ensslin/index.html) at MPI for Astrophysics in Garching. Here the code _weak_lensing_with_nifty.py_ was the project I was working on. I also uploaded the presentation as well as the results initially generated and discussed in the presentation.
