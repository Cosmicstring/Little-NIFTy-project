# Little-NIFTy-project

A little project done during the NIFTy course given by the [IFT group](https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~ensslin/index.html) at MPI for Astrophysics in Garching. Here the code _weak_lensing_with_NIFTy_Wiener_Filter.py_ was the project I was working on. I also uploaded the presentation as well as the results initially generated and discussed in the presentation. To use the code one would need to install the [NIFTy](http://ift.pages.mpcdf.de/nifty/) library, as well as the [galsim](http://galsim-developers.github.io/GalSim/_build/html/overview.html) library.

Theory needed for understanding the work done available at the [lecture website](https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~ensslin/lectures/lectures.html) of the IFT group also.
